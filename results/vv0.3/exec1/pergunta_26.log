Pergunta: who argued with congress during the early years of reconstruction

Resposta:
During the early years of Reconstruction, there were many individuals who argued with Congress about various aspects of the post-Civil War period. One notable figure was Andrew Johnson, who served as President after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Johnson disagreed with many of the policies proposed by Radical Republicans in Congress, particularly those related to civil rights for freed slaves and the readmission of Southern states to the Union.

Another individual who frequently argued with Congress during this time was Ulysses S. Grant, who served as General-in-Chief of the United States Army from 1864 to 1869. Grant advocated for a more lenient approach towards the South and opposed some of the harsher measures proposed by Radical Republicans in Congress.

Other figures who argued with Congress during Reconstruction include Frederick Douglass, a prominent abolitionist and advocate for civil rights for African Americans, and Southern politicians such as Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, who disagreed with the terms of Reconstruction and the federal government's efforts to rebuild the South.
