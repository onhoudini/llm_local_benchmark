Pergunta: who sings now that we have love what are we going to do with it

Resposta:
The lyrics you've provided, "Now that we have love, what are we going to do with it?" is not from a specific known song. It seems like a question rather than a line from a popular song. If you meant a different phrase or if there's a particular artist or song you were thinking of, please let me know!
