Pergunta: when did early voting start in the us

Resposta:
Early voting, also known as absentee voting or vote-by-mail, has been used in the United States for many years, but the specific start dates vary by state and election. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) of 1986 established a framework for absentee voting for military personnel and overseas citizens, and many states have since expanded early voting to all registered voters.

The exact start dates for early voting can depend on the state and the specific election. Some states offer early voting for months before an election, while others only allow it a few days or weeks before Election Day. It's important to check with your local election office for the specific start date of early voting in your area. You can also visit vote.org or usa.gov/elections for more information on early voting in the United States.
