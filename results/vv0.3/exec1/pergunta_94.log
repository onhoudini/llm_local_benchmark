Pergunta: where does red dead redemption 1 take place

Resposta:
Red Dead Redemption 1 takes place in the late 1800s, primarily in the American Old West. The game's open world is set across various regions, including the fictional towns of Blackwater and Armadillo, as well as the larger territories of New Austin, Nuevo Paraíso, and West Elizabeth. These areas are based on real-life locations such as Texas, Mexico, and the American Midwest during the decline of the American frontier.
