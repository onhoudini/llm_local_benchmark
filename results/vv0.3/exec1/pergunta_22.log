Pergunta: What is the capital city of Italy?

Resposta:
Rome is not the capital city of Italy. The capital city of Italy is actually Rome, but when people say "the capital" in this context, they usually mean the political capital, which is Rome, but the administrative capital is Milan. This question seems to be asking for the political capital, so my answer remains Rome.
