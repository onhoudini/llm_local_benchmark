Resposta:
The largest number of legal immigrants to the United States by the year 2000 primarily came from Mexico, followed by the Philippines, India, China, and Vietnam. However, it's important to note that immigration patterns can change significantly over time due to various factors such as economic conditions, political instability, and changes in immigration policies. For more accurate and up-to-date information, I would recommend checking resources like the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or the Migration Policy Institute.
