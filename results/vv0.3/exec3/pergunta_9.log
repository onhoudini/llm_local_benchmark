Pergunta: What animal is known as the king of the jungle?

Resposta:
The lion is often referred to as the "king of the jungle," although it's important to note that lions primarily reside in savannas and grasslands, not jungles. The misconception arises due to their dominance in their ecosystem and the dramatic portrayal of them in media.
