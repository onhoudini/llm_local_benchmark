Pergunta: who is the security general of the un

Resposta:
The United Nations does not have a Security General. The correct title is Secretary-General, and the current UN Secretary-General is António Guterres. The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has an Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations who oversees the military and police personnel in peacekeeping missions. However, this position does not equate to a "Security General."
