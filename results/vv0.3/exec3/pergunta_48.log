Pergunta: where was the lion king musical first performed

Resposta:
The Lion King musical had its world premiere on July 8, 1997, at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as part of the Tony Award-winning musical's out-of-town tryout. However, it is most famously associated with its Broadway debut on October 15, 1997, at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City. The show was later transferred to the Minskoff Theatre in 2006, where it has been running ever since.
