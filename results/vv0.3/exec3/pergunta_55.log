Pergunta: What vitamin is produced when skin is exposed to sunlight?

Resposta:
Vitamin D is the vitamin that is produced when skin is exposed to sunlight. Specifically, it's a type of vitamin D called vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) that our bodies produce in response to sunlight. However, it's important to note that factors such as latitude, time of day, season, and skin pigmentation can affect the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight.
