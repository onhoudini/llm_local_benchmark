Pergunta: when did rolex daytona stop using zenith movement

Resposta:
The Rolex Daytona stopped using Zenith movements in the late 1980s. From 1963 to 1988, Rolex used the Valjoux 72 or 72B (manufactured by Zenith) for their Daytona models. In 1988, Rolex introduced an in-house automatic chronograph movement, the caliber 4030, which replaced the Zenith-based movements.
