Pergunta: who is the tallest woman in the world and how tall is she

Resposta:
The tallest woman ever recorded was Rumeysa Ari from Turkey. She reached a height of 2 meters and 32 centimeters (approximately 7 feet 7 inches) at the age of 18. However, it's important to note that her height has fluctuated due to health issues. As of my last update, she is no longer the tallest woman in the world. Always remember that these records can change over time as new individuals may grow taller.
