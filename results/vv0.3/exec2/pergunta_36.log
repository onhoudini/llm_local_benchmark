Pergunta: which console to get red dead redemption 2

Resposta:
Red Dead Redemption 2 is available on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. If you already have one of these consoles, I would recommend sticking with that for compatibility reasons. However, if you don't have either, it might be worth considering the features offered by each console to decide which one better suits your needs. For example, the PlayStation 4 has exclusive games and services like PlayStation Plus, while the Xbox One offers features such as Game Pass, which provides access to a large library of games for a monthly fee. Ultimately, the choice depends on your personal preferences and gaming habits.
