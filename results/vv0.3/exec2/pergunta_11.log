Pergunta: what color is the president of south koreas house

Resposta:
The President of South Korea does not live in a house, but in the Blue House, also known as Cheong Wa Dae. However, the color you're asking about isn't directly applicable to the building itself, as it's primarily white with blue trim. But if you're referring to the dominant color, it would be blue.
