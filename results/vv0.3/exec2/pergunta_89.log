Pergunta: What planet is known as the Morning Star?

Resposta:
Venus is known as the Morning Star because it can be seen in the eastern sky before sunrise. However, it's also called the Evening Star when it appears in the western sky after sunset, but this is due to its orbit around the Sun and not a different identity. The same planet is being observed under different phases of its orbit.
