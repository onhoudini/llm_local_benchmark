Pergunta: who os the father of bridget jones baby

Resposta:
In the novel "Bridget Jones's Diary" by Helen Fielding and its film adaptation, Bridget Jones's baby's father is revealed to be Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth in the movie). However, in a later film "Bridget Jones's Baby," released in 2016, the baby's father is revealed to be both Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver (played by Hugh Grant), as Bridget becomes pregnant through an affair with each man without knowing which one was the father at the time.
