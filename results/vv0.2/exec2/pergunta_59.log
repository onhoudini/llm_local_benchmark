Pergunta: What is the smallest continent by land area?

Resposta:
The smallest continent by land area is Australia, with approximately 7.69 million square kilometers (2.97 million square miles). However, if we include the island territories that are often considered part of Europe, then Europe becomes the smallest continent in terms of land area, with about 10.18 million square kilometers (3.93 million square miles). But when speaking about continents without their islands, Australia is the smallest.
