Pergunta: What is the largest desert in the world?

Resposta:
The largest desert in the world is the Antarctic Desert. It covers about 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles). However, it's important to note that deserts are often defined as areas that receive very little precipitation each year, so some people may argue that the largest hot desert is the Arabian Desert or the largest cold desert is the Antarctic Ice Sheet rather than the deserts as a whole. Regardless, the Antarctic Desert holds the title when considering all types of deserts.
