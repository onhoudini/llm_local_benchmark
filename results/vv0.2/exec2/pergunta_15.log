Pergunta: when did early voting start in the us

Resposta:
Early voting dates and eligibility vary greatly from state to state in the United States. Some states offer no-excuse early voting, which means any registered voter can vote before Election Day without providing a reason. Other states only allow early voting under certain circumstances, such as being out of town on Election Day or having a disability.

The first state to adopt early voting was Wisconsin in 1912, but it was limited to specific groups like military personnel and their families, and certain disabled voters. The modern trend of expanding early voting began in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, many states have adopted early voting as a way to increase voter turnout and reduce wait times on Election Day.

It's important to note that the specific start dates for early voting can vary widely from state to state and even within individual jurisdictions. For example, some states offer in-person early voting for several weeks leading up to Election Day, while others only allow absentee voting by mail beforehand. To find out when early voting starts in a particular state or locality, it's best to check with the relevant election office or secretary of state website.
