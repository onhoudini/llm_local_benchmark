Pergunta: What organ is responsible for breathing in humans?

Resposta:
The organ primarily responsible for breathing in humans is the lungs. However, the process of breathing is initiated by the muscles of the chest and diaphragm, which contract and expand the thoracic cavity to allow air to enter (inhale) or leave (exhale) the body through the nose or mouth. The lungs then exchange gases with the bloodstream in a process called respiration.
