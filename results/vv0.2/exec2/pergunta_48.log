Resposta:
The Lion King musical had its world premiere on July 8, 1997, at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as part of the Theatre de la Jeune Lune's 1997-1998 season. It was not originally produced by Disney Theatrical Productions; instead, it was a collaboration between the theatre company and Disney. The show moved to Broadway in October 1997 and opened on November 13, 1997, at the New Amsterdam Theatre. Since then, it has become one of the longest-running shows on Broadway and has been performed in numerous productions around the world.
