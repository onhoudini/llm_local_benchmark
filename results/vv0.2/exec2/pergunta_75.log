Pergunta: What is the capital city of India?

Resposta:
The capital city of India is New Delhi. It is important to note that while New Delhi serves as the administrative capital, the political power lies in Delhi, which is a National Capital Territory and not a state. Thus, New Delhi is often referred to as the joint capital with Mumbai being the financial capital and Bangalore being the IT hub of India.
