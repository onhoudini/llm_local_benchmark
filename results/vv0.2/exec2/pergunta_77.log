Pergunta: How many legs does an insect have?

Resposta:
An insect typically has six legs. However, there are some exceptions like the mayfly and the archipterygian order of insects which have three pairs of legs for a total of 10 legs, and the apterygote insects such as springtails and silverfish which have only two main body segments and thus only three or four pairs of legs for a total of six to eight legs. But the most common number is six.
