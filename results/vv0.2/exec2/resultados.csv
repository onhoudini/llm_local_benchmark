Here's how it works:  September 15 falls in two different zodiac signs  depending on when the Sun enters each sign during the year.

For example: - If your birthday is on or before September 14  then you are a Virgo. - If your birthday is on or after September 15  then you are a Libra.  So  for September 15 specifically  the zodiac sign can be either Virgo or Libra  depending on the year. To determine which one it is for a particular year  you would need to know the exact date of the autumnal equinox (around September 23) that year and compare it to September 15.
