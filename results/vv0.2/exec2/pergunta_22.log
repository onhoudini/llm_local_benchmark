Pergunta: What is the capital city of Italy?

Resposta:
The capital city of Italy is Rome. However, it's important to note that while Rome is the political heart of the country, it's not where all government functions take place. The Italian Parliament and the Italian Government offices are located in Rome, but the President of the Italian Republic resides in the Quirinal Palace in Rome, but works in the nearby Palazzo Chigi in Rome as his office. The Constitutional Court and the Council of State have their seats in Florence and Rome respectively. So while Rome is the de facto capital city, it's not entirely accurate to say that all government functions take place there
