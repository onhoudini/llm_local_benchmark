Pergunta: who sang vande maataram in 1896 congress session

Resposta:
Vande Mataram, a song from Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel "Anandamath," was first sung as a hymn during the 1896 Indian National Congress session. However, it is important to note that no specific individual artist or singer is credited with singing Vande Mataram at this congress session. The song was chanted collectively by the attendees as a form of protest against British rule and as an expression of their nationalistic sentiments.
