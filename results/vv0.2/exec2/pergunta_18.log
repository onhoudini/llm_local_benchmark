Pergunta: What is the hardest natural substance on Earth?

Resposta:
The hardest naturally occurring substance on Earth is diamond. Diamonds are made of carbon atoms arranged in a crystal structure where each atom is covalently bonded to its neighbors in a tetrahedral arrangement. This strong chemical bonding results in the exceptional hardness of diamonds, making them capable of scratching even other minerals that are typically considered hard, such as corundum (the mineral family that includes rubies and sapphires).
