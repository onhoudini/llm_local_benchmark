Pergunta: What blood type is known as the universal donor?

Resposta:
A person with Type O blood is considered a universal donor because their blood can be given to individuals with Type A, Type B, and Type AB blood types. However, it's important to note that Type O blood has Rh factors (Rh+ or Rh-), so a universal donor could be either an O+ or an O- donor depending on the Rh factor of the recipient.
