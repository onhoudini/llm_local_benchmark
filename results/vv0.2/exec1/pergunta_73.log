Pergunta: What gas is released by plants during photosynthesis?

Resposta:
The primary gas released by plants during the process of photosynthesis is oxygen (O2). This gas is produced as a byproduct when water molecules are split to release hydrogen ions and electrons, which are used in the creation of glucose from carbon dioxide (CO2) through the light-dependent reactions. The oxygen is then released into the atmosphere as a waste product.
