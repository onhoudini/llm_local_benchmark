Resposta:
In the Disney Channel Original Series "Boy Meets World," Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) and Topanga Lawrence-Matthews (Danielle Fishel) reunite after their college graduation, which occurs between seasons 5 and 6. However, they do not officially get back together until the series finale in season 7, episode 22, titled "To Love and Learn." This is after Lauren (Melissa Joan Hart), Cory's first love and high school sweetheart, has left the picture.
