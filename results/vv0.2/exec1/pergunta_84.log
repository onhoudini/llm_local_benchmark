Pergunta: What is the capital city of Switzerland?

Resposta:
The capital city of Switzerland is Bern. However, it's important to note that unlike many countries, Switzerland does not have a single formal capital city. Bern is the seat of the federal government, but each canton (state) has its own capital city.
