Pergunta: which console to get red dead redemption 2

Resposta:
Red Dead Redemption 2 is available on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. Your decision on which console to get may depend on several factors such as your existing gaming platform, any ongoing subscription services or exclusive content you may have, and personal preferences like controller layout or interface. If you're currently using one of these consoles for your games, it might be more convenient to stick with what you have. However, if you don't have either console yet, you could consider the features and benefits of each platform before making a decision. For instance, PlayStation offers exclusive access to some games and services like PlayStation Plus, while Xbox has its Game Pass subscription service that provides a large library of games for a monthly fee. Ultimately, the choice is yours based on your gaming needs and preferences.
