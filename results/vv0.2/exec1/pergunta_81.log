Pergunta: What is the capital city of Greece?

Resposta:
The capital city of Greece is Athens. However, it's important to note that Athens is also the largest city in Greece and has been the historical and cultural heart of the country for many centuries. The administrative and political center of the Greek government is located in Athens, but the official capital designation was moved from Athens to the more central location of Athens-Phaleron in 1834, which is now known as the "Capital Central Greece" or "Temporary Capital." However, in practice and for most purposes, Athens is considered the capital city.
