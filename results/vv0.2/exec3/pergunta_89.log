Pergunta: What planet is known as the Morning Star?

Resposta:
The planet Venus is referred to as the "Morning Star" when it appears in the eastern sky before sunrise. This is because, from Earth's perspective, Venus can be seen shining brightly just before sunrise, heralding the dawn. Similarly, Venus is also known as the "Evening Star" when it appears in the western sky after sunset.
