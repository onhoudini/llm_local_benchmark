Pergunta: when did the water bottle flip challenge start

Resposta:
The water bottle flip challenge is a viral social media trend that has been around since at least 2014. However, it gained significant popularity in 2016 when a video of a student named Michael Senatore flipping a full water bottle over and over again until it landed on the top went viral on Vine and later YouTube. Since then, many people have attempted to replicate the feat or put their own spin on the challenge by adding various obstacles or using different types of bottles.
