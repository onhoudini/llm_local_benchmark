Pergunta: What is the largest mammal on Earth?

Resposta:
The largest mammal on Earth is the blue whale. Blue whales can reach lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weigh as much as 200 tons (181 metric tonnes). They are found in all oceans, but most commonly in the polar regions. Despite their size, blue whales feed primarily on krill, which are shrimp-like crustaceans.
