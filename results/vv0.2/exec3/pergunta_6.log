Pergunta: who governs in america’s representative democracy (republic) system

Resposta:
In the United States, which is a representative democratic republic, the government is divided among three branches to ensure a balance of power and prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.

1. Legislative Branch: The legislative branch is responsible for making laws. It is composed of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Senators serve six-year terms, while Representatives serve two-year terms. Members of Congress are elected by the people through direct elections.

2. Executive Branch: The executive branch is responsible for enforcing the laws. It is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the military. The President is elected every four years through an electoral college system.

3. Judicial Branch: The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws. It is composed of federal courts, including the Supreme Court, which has the power to declare laws unconstitutional. Judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

So, in summary, the people of the United States govern through their elected representatives in Congress, the President, and the judiciary.
