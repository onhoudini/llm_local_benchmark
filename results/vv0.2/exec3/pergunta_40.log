Pergunta: What metal is liquid at room temperature?

Resposta:
No metal is liquid at room temperature. The most common metals become liquid at temperatures above 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). Mercury is an exception, as it is a liquid at room temperature, but it's not considered a common metal due to its unique properties.
