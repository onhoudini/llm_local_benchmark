Pergunta: where was the eastern front located in ww1

Resposta:
The Eastern Front during World War I referred to the theater of war between the Russian Empire and the Central Powers (primarily Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria) in Eastern Europe. It extended from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, and from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to the Caucasus Mountains in the east.

The major battles on the Eastern Front included the Galician Offensive (1914), the Brusilov Offensive (1916), and the Battle of Riga (1917). The front line shifted frequently throughout the war, with significant territorial gains and losses for both sides.

It's important to note that the Eastern Front was a much larger theater of war than the Western Front, which is often more well-known due to its impact on world history through the involvement of France, Britain, and the United States. However, the Eastern Front saw some of the bloodiest battles and highest casualty rates of World War I.
