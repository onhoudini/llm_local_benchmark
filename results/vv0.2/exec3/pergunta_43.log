Pergunta: What is the main ingredient in bread?

Resposta:
The main ingredient in bread is flour, typically made from wheat, but other types of flour such as rice or corn can also be used. Other essential ingredients include water, yeast or baking powder for leavening, salt, and sometimes sugar. However, the main structure of the bread comes from the gluten formed when flour is mixed with water and kneaded.
