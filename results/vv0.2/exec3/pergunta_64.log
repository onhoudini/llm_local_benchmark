Pergunta: who decided what rights should be included in the convention on the rights of the child

Resposta:
The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is an international human rights treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1989. The process of drafting the CRC involved extensive research and consultation with various organizations, experts, and governments around the world.

The initiative for a convention on children's rights came from several sources, including UNICEF, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Save the Children and the World Council of Churches. The drafting process was led by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, with input from a Working Group of Experts on Drafting the Convention.

The CRC reflects a broad consensus among governments, civil society, and experts about the fundamental rights of children. It is based on four core principles: the best interests of the child, non-discrimination, survival and development, and participation. The Convention sets out specific rights in areas such as education, health, protection from abuse and neglect, and cultural identity.

The final text of the CRC was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1989, and it entered into force
