Pergunta: what color is the president of south koreas house

Resposta:
The President of South Korea resides in a building called the "Blue House" (Cheong Wa Dae in Korean). However, the name "Blue House" does not refer to the actual color of the building. Instead, it is named after the blue pine trees that surround it. The main building itself is two-storied and primarily made of white concrete with some red elements. So, while the Blue House is not actually blue in color, it is often symbolically referred to as such due to its name and the surrounding blue pine trees.
