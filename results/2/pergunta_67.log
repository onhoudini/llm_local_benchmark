Pergunta: what do you call a vest in the uk

Resposta:
In the UK, a vest is typically referred to as a "waistcoat." A waistcoat is a garment that covers the upper body from the chest up, leaving the midriff exposed. It usually fastens with buttons and is often worn as part of a formal outfit, such as a three-piece suit. However, it's important to note that the term "vest" is also used in the UK for a garment similar to an American-style vest, which covers the torso and arms but leaves the midriff exposed. But in a more formal or traditional context, waistcoat would be the correct term.
