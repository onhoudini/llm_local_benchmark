mistral_v0.2,90,what are the three types of wind turbines,There are generally three main types of wind turbines based on their design and functionality:  1. Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT): This is the most common type of wind turbine  where the rotor blades are mounted on a horizontal axis that is perpendicular to the ground.
