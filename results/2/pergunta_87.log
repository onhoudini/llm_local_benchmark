Pergunta: name of the bird in the lion king

Resposta:
In Disney's "The Lion King," there isn't a bird named specifically as a character that interacts with Simba, Mufasa, or the other lion characters. However, there are several birds that make appearances throughout the film. The most notable one is Zazu, who is not a bird of the feathered variety but rather a majordomo and red-billed hornbill, depicted as an animated character with avian features. So, while there isn't a named bird character in "The Lion King," Zazu comes close!
