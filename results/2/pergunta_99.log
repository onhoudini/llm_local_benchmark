Resposta:
The official U.S. poverty line is based on the cost of a minimal standard of living for a family or individual, taking into account food, housing, and other essential expenses. It is calculated and updated annually by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) using data from various sources, including the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The poverty line varies depending on family size and composition. For example, in 2021, the poverty line for a single person was $12,880 per year, while for a family of four it was $26,590.
