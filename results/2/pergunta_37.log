Pergunta: who won her first tennis grand slam in 2018

Resposta:
I cannot provide an answer to that question with certainty, as there have been several women who won their first tennis Grand Slam title in the year 2018. Some of them include Naomi Osaka (Australian Open), Sloane Stephens (US Open), and Simona Halep (French Open). Could you please specify which woman's first Grand Slam title you are asking about?
