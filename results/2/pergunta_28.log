Pergunta: when did rolex daytona stop using zenith movement

Resposta:
The Rolex Daytona watch stopped using Zenith movements in the late 1980s or early 1990s, depending on the specific reference number. Prior to this time, some Rolex Daytonas were powered by Zenith El Primero automatic chronograph movements.

The transition from Zenith movements to in-house Rolex calibers began with the introduction of the Rolex Caliber 4130 in 2000. This new movement was specifically designed for the Rolex Daytona and has been used in all subsequent models.

Therefore, if you have a Rolex Daytona watch and want to know if it uses a Zenith movement, you can check the reference number or consult the serial number with Rolex or an authorized dealer. Generally speaking, any Rolex Daytona produced before 1988 is likely to have a Zenith movement, while those produced after 2000 will have an in-house Rolex caliber. Watches from the late 1980s and early 1990s may be transitional models with both Rolex and Zenith components.
