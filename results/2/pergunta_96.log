Pergunta: when do meredith and derek get back together in season 2

Resposta:
In Season 2 of "Grey's Anatomy," Meredith and Derek's relationship goes through several ups and downs. They break up after Meredith discovers that Derek slept with his ex-wife, Addison Shepherd, during their brief separation. This happens in the episode titled "A Change Is Gonna Come," which is the 13th episode of the season.

However, they don't get back together until much later in the season. In the penultimate episode, "Freedom From the Known," Meredith realizes that she still has feelings for Derek and goes to him to confess. They share a heartfelt moment, but they don't officially reconcile until the season finale, "Losing My Mind," in which they sleep together.

So, technically, Meredith and Derek don't get back together until the last two episodes of Season 2.
