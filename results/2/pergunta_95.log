Pergunta: what is the star sign for september 15

Resposta:
The star sign for someone born on September 15 depends on the specific year they were born. Here's a breakdown of the star signs for each part of September:

- If you were born between September 23 and October 22, then your star sign is Libra.
- If you were born between September 22 and September 22 (in a leap year), then your star sign is Virgo, as the astrological new year begins on March 21, so the last few days of one sign fall into the previous year.
- If you were born between September 1 and September 22, then your star sign is Virgo.

So, for someone born on September 15, their star sign would typically be Virgo, as there are not enough days left in the month for them to be born under Libra. However, if they were born in a leap year on September 15, then they would be a Virgo-Libra cusp child, which is sometimes considered to have traits of both signs.
