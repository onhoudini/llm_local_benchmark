Pergunta: when the united states entered world war 1 it joined what powers

Resposta:
When the United States entered World War 1, it joined the Allied Powers. The Allied Powers were primarily made up of Europeans nations such as France, Great Britain, Russia, and Belgium, who were opposed to the Central Powers, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. The United States initially maintained a policy of neutrality towards the conflict but eventually entered the war on April 6, 1917, following several events that shifted public opinion in favor of intervention, such as unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany against American ships and the interception of the Zimmerman Telegram, which revealed a German plan to encourage Mexico to attack the United States.
