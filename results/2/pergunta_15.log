Pergunta: when did early voting start in the us

Resposta:
Early voting dates and eligibility vary greatly from state to state in the United States. Some states offer no-excuse early voting, which means any registered voter can vote before Election Day without providing a reason. Other states only allow early voting under certain circumstances, such as being out of town on Election Day or having a disability.

The first state to adopt early voting was Wisconsin in 1912, but it was not widely used until the late 20th century. The trend towards expanding early voting gained momentum after the 2000 presidential election, which was decided by a controversial Supreme Court ruling in Bush v. Gore. Since then, many states have implemented early voting to help reduce long lines and wait times at polling places on Election Day.

The exact start of early voting depends on each state's laws and regulations. Some states offer early voting for several weeks before Election Day, while others only allow it a few days before. To find out when early voting starts in a specific state, you can check the website of that state's election office or secretary of state.
