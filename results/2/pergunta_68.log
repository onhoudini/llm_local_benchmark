Resposta:
In Japan, children typically start kindergarten at the age of 6 or 7. They then attend six years of primary school from around the age of 6 to 12. After that, they attend three years of junior high school, usually starting around the age of 13 and finishing when they are around 15. Finally, they attend three years of senior high school, typically starting at around 16 and graduating at 18 or 19. Some students may choose to attend university or other higher education institutions after completing high school. So, in summary, children in Japan usually start formal schooling around the age of 6 and continue until their late teens.
