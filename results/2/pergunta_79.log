Pergunta: which part of a corn plant would the kernels be

Resposta:
The kernels of corn are located in the ears or cob of the corn plant. An ear of corn is actually a compact inf Inflorescence, meaning it's a specialized flowering structure. Each kernel is essentially a seed enclosed by the protective layers, including the pericarp (outer layer) and the testa (inner layer). So, when we eat corn, we are essentially consuming the seeds of the plant.
