Pergunta: when did the water bottle flip challenge start

Resposta:
The water bottle flip challenge is a viral social media trend that has been around since at least 2014. However, it gained significant popularity in 2016 when a video of a student named Michael Senatore flipping not one but five water bottles in a row during a live broadcast on Periscope went viral. Since then, the challenge has spread widely on various social media platforms, with many people attempting to flip their own water bottles and posting their attempts online.
