Pergunta: what place did jennifer hudson get in american idol

Resposta:
Jennifer Hudson was a contestant on the third season of American Idol in 2004. She finished seventh place during the live performance shows. However, her elimination from the competition did not hinder her successful career in music that followed. After leaving American Idol, she released her debut album "Jennifer Hudson" in 2008 which included her breakout single "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going," a powerful rendition of a song from the musical "Dreamgirls." She went on to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Grammy Award for that performance.
