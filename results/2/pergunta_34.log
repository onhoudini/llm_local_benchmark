Pergunta: what was the last episode of inspector morse

Resposta:
The last episode of Inspector Morse, a British television series, aired on ITV on January 16, 1993. The episode is titled "The Daughters of Cain." In this final installment, Morse investigates the murder of a young woman and her connection to a wealthy family. As always, Morse's brilliant deductive reasoning and attention to detail help him solve the case. However, unlike previous episodes, there is no resolution for Morse's personal life or his ongoing search for the killer of his wife. Instead, the series ended with an open-ended cliffhanger, leaving viewers wondering about Morse's future. The character of Inspector Morse was later revived in a spin-off series called "Lewis," which ran from 2006 to 2015.
