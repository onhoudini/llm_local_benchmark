Pergunta: which console to get red dead redemption 2

Resposta:
Red Dead Redemption 2 is available on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. Your decision on which console to get may depend on several factors such as your existing gaming platform, any ongoing subscription services or exclusive content you may have, and personal preferences like controller layout or interface. If you're currently using one of these consoles for your games and are happy with the experience, it might be more convenient to stick with that one. However, if you don't have a preference, both versions offer identical gameplay content.
