Pergunta: what is the front of your lower leg called

Resposta:
The front part of the lower leg is called the anterior or anterior aspect. It is the side that faces forward when you are standing with your legs together and your hands at your sides. Specific anatomical structures on the anterior lower leg include the tibia, the shin muscle (anterior tibial muscle), and the skin and subcutaneous tissue. However, if you're asking about a specific landmark or structure, such as the tibial plateau or the tibial tuberosity, please let me know so I can provide more accurate information.
