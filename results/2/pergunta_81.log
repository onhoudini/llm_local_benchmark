Pergunta: who is going to the orange bowl this year

Resposta:
I cannot provide an answer to that question as I don't have real-time access to information or the ability to predict future events. The Orange Bowl is a college football bowl game, and the teams participating in it are determined through various selection processes based on their performance during the regular season. To find out who is playing in this year's Orange Bowl, you would need to check the official College Football Playoff or Orange Bowl Committee announcements.
