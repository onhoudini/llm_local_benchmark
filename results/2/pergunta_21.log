Pergunta: which piece of legislation placed the protections in the european convention on human rights

Resposta:
The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is not a piece of legislation that was placed within another legal document. Instead, it is a treaty that was signed and ratified by various European countries to protect human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. It was drafted in response to the atrocities committed during World War II and came into force on September 3, 1953. The ECHR established the European Court of Human Rights, which is responsible for interpreting the Convention and ensuring that its provisions are upheld by the contracting parties.
