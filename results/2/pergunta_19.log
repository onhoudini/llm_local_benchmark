Pergunta: when is the draw for the european championships 2020

Resposta:
I apologize for any confusion, but there seems to be some misinformation in your question. The European Championship football tournament, which is usually referred to as Euro 2020 because it was scheduled to be held across multiple European cities in 2020, did not have a draw event specifically for the year 2020.

Instead, the draw for the Euro 2020 groups took place on November 30, 2019, in Bucharest, Romania. The tournament was eventually postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the groups were determined based on the original schedule.

Therefore, if you meant to ask about the Euro 2020 draw date, the answer is November 30, 2019.
