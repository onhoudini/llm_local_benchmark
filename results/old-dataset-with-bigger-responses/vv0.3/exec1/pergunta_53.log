Pergunta: who came up with the name rock and roll

Resposta:
The term "rock and roll" as a musical genre originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It's difficult to pinpoint one specific person who coined the phrase, but it was widely used by African-American musicians and jazz critics to describe a style of music that combined elements of blues, gospel, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues. One of the earliest recorded uses of the term in this context was by disc jockey Alan Freed, who popularized the genre through his radio show "Moondog Rock 'n' Roll Party" in the 1950s. However, it's important to note that the roots of rock and roll can be traced back even further to earlier musical styles like blues and jazz.
