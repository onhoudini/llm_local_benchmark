Pergunta: who is the nationalist leader associated with the american revolution

Resposta:
There wasn't a single nationalist leader specifically associated with the American Revolution as such, as the Revolution was a collective effort by many individuals. However, some key figures who played significant roles in advocating for American independence and shaping the nation's early nationalism include:

1. Thomas Jefferson - Drafted the Declaration of Independence and served as the third U.S. President.
2. George Washington - Led the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and became the first U.S. President.
3. Benjamin Franklin - A Founding Father who was instrumental in drafting the Declaration of Independence, negotiating the Treaty of Paris (which ended the war), and serving as the first U.S. Postmaster General.
4. John Adams - Served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, helped draft the Declaration of Independence, and later became the second U.S. President.
5. Alexander Hamilton - A key figure in the early American government who served as the first Secretary of the Treasury and was instrumental in shaping the country's financial system.

These individuals, among others, can be considered nationalist leaders associated with the American Revolution due to their significant contributions
