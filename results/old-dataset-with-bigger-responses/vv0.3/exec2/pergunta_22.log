Pergunta: who sang vande maataram in 1896 congress session

Resposta:
The song "Vande Mataram" was first sung at the 1896 Congress Session by Sister Nivedita, an Irish-born disciple of Swami Vivekananda. However, it was originally composed by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in his novel "Anandamath" in 1870. The song gained significant popularity during the Indian independence movement and was sung by many leaders, including Lokmanya Tilak and Subhas Chandra Bose, but Sister Nivedita's rendition at the 1896 Congress Session is particularly notable.
