Pergunta: what do you call a vest in the uk

Resposta:
In the UK, a vest is often referred to as a "waistcoat." However, it can also be called a "vest top" or simply a "vest," especially when referring to a sleeveless garment worn as an undergarment. But for clarity, "waistcoat" is the most common term used in formal and traditional contexts.
