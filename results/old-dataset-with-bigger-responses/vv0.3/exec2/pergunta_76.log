Pergunta: what is the meaning of the name vinay

Resposta:
The name Vinay has multiple origins and meanings. In Sanskrit, it means "discipline" or "self-control." In Hindi, it can also be a shortened form of the name Vinod, which means "pleasant" or "delightful." In Vietnamese, Vinh is a common spelling for the name and it means "peace" or "tranquility." It's always best to ask the person with that name about their personal interpretation if possible.
