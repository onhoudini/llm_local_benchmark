Pergunta: where did france colonize in the new world

Resposta:
France colonized several regions in the Americas during the Age of Exploration, primarily focusing on North America and the Caribbean. Some of the most notable French colonies include:

1. Quebec (Canada): Founded by Samuel de Champlain in 1608, Quebec City is one of the oldest European settlements in North America. The region later became known as New France and included present-day provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and parts of the United States like Louisiana and Acadia (now Nova Scotia).

2. French Caribbean: France established several colonies in the Caribbean, including Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, and French Guiana. These islands were primarily used for sugar production and slave labor.

3. Louisiana: In 1682, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville established a settlement at Biloxi, Mississippi, which later became known as French Louisiana. The region was ceded to Spain in 1763 after the Seven Years' War but was returned to France in 1800 and eventually sold to the United States in 1803.
