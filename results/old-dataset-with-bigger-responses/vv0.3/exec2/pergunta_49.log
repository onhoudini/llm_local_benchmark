Resposta:
losses that occur when home loan borrowers default on their mortgages. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides mortgage insurance on loans made by FHA-approved lenders, which allows these lenders to offer more favorable terms to borrowers who might not qualify for conventional loans due to limited credit histories or low down payments. This helps increase homeownership opportunities for individuals and families with lower incomes.
