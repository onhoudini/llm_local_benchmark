Pergunta: icc world cup outside england first time sponsor

Resposta:
The first ICC World Cup held outside England that had a sponsor was the 1975 World Cup in England and Wales, which was sponsored by PepsiCo. However, the first ICC World Cup held entirely outside England was the 1979 World Cup in West Indies, which was sponsored by John Player Special. But if you're asking about the first time a non-tobacco or non-beverage company sponsored an ICC World Cup outside England, that would be the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, which was sponsored by Visa.
