Pergunta: what is the star sign for september 15

Resposta:
The star sign for September 15 depends on the exact time and location of birth. However, if we consider the tropical zodiac (most commonly used in Western astrology), people born between approximately September 1 and September 23 are considered Virgos, while those born from around September 24 onwards are Libra. For a precise star sign, it's best to look up the specific birth date and time.
