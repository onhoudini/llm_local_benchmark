Pergunta: which piece of legislation placed the protections in the european convention on human rights

Resposta:
The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was not created by a single piece of legislation, but rather it is an international treaty drafted and signed in Rome on November 4, 1950. It came into force on September 3, 1953. The ECHR established the European Court of Human Rights to hear cases from individuals claiming that their rights under the Convention have been violated by a state party to the Convention. The Convention has been ratified by 47 member states of the Council of Europe, including all the EU countries plus non-EU members such as Russia and Turkey.
