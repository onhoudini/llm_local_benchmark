Pergunta: who played the mom in the home alone movies

Resposta:
The character of the mother in the Home Alone movies was named Pam Buxton, and she was portrayed by actress Catherine O'Hara. However, it's important to note that her character only appeared in the first movie, as she passed away in a car accident before the events of the second film. In the sequels, the role of Kevin McCallister's mother was played by Hillary Wolf as an adult and Kieran Culkin as a child (Kevin's older brother Buzz).
