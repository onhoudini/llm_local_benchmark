Pergunta: who is going to the orange bowl this year

Resposta:
I don't have real-time information, so I can't tell you who is going to the Orange Bowl this year. The Orange Bowl is a college football bowl game, and the teams participating change each year based on the results of the college football season. To find out who is playing in this year's Orange Bowl, you should check the latest news or official sources such as the Orange Bowl website or ESPN.
