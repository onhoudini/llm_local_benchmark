Pergunta: what is the italian word musicians use to describe playing a stringed instrument with a bow

Resposta:
The Italian term that musicians use to describe playing a stringed instrument with a bow is "suonare il violino" or simply "violino". However, if you're referring specifically to the act of using a bow, it would be "suonare col arco". But remember, this term can be used for any stringed instrument played with a bow, such as the viola or cello. If you want to specify that it's a violin being played with a bow, you could say "suonare il violino col arco".
