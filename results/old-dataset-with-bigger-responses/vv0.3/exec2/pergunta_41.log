Pergunta: when did the harry potter movie come out

Resposta:
The first Harry Potter movie, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," was released on November 16, 2001. However, it was titled "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in North America due to a difference in naming conventions for magic-related terms between the UK and the US. The series continued with eight more movies, concluding with "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2" on July 15, 2011.
