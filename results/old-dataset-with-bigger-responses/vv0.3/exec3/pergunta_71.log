Pergunta: when did the monarchy in england lose their power

Resposta:
The monarchy in England, now known as the United Kingdom, underwent significant changes in its power structure over centuries. However, a major shift occurred during the Glorious Revolution of 1688, often considered the end of absolute monarchy and the beginning of constitutional monarchy. King James II was deposed, and his daughter Mary (a Protestant) and her husband William of Orange (also a Protestant) were invited to take the throne. This event established the supremacy of Parliament over the monarch, limiting the power of the king or queen.

However, it's important to note that the monarchy still plays an important ceremonial role in British politics today. The current system is known as a constitutional monarchy, where the monarch acts as a figurehead and exercises little political power but performs various ceremonial duties.
