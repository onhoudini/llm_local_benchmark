Pergunta: what time period is a league of their own

Resposta:
"A League of Their Own" is a reference to a movie, not a specific time period. The movie is set during World War II, more specifically in 1943 when the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) was founded as a replacement for Major League Baseball (MLB) players who were serving in the military. The movie follows the Rockford Peaches, a fictional team in the AAGPBL.
