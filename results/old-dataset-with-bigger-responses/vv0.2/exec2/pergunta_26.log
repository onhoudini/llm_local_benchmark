Pergunta: who argued with congress during the early years of reconstruction

Resposta:
During the early years of Reconstruction (1865-1877), several individuals argued with Congress on various issues related to the rebuilding of the Southern states after the Civil War. Some of the most prominent figures include:

1. Andrew Johnson: Johnson, who became President upon Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865, clashed with Congress over his lenient Reconstruction policies. He vetoed several bills passed by Congress to protect the civil and political rights of newly freed slaves, leading to a series of bitter debates and constitutional showdowns.
2. Thaddeus Stevens: Stevens, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and a key figure in the Radical Reconstruction wing of the party, advocated for strong measures to ensure the full citizenship rights of African Americans. He clashed with Johnson over issues such as voting rights, land redistribution, and military occupation of the Southern states.
3. Frederick Douglass: Douglass, an abolitionist leader and former slave, argued for the need for strong federal intervention in the South to protect the civil and political rights of African Americans. He testified before Congress on several occasions and used his speeches and writings to advocate for Reconstruction
