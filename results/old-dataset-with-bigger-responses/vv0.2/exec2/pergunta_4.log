Resposta:
The statue you might be referring to is the "Freedom Statue" or the "Freedom Stone," which is part of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial located in Washington D.C. This statue represents a soldier emerging from the ground, symbolizing the rebirth and new beginning that veterans experience after their military service.

Another famous statue coming out of the ground in Washington D.C. is the "Albert Pike Statue," which was removed in 2017 due to its controversial history. However, it's important to note that these two statues have different meanings and symbolism.
