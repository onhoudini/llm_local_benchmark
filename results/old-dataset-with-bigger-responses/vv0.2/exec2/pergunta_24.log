Pergunta: what is the most uneducated state in america

Resposta:
It's important to note that making a definitive statement about which state in America is the "most uneducated" is not accurate or fair, as education levels can vary greatly within individual states and there are many factors that contribute to educational attainment. Additionally, the term "uneducated" can be subjective and open to interpretation.

According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2019, the states with the lowest percentage of residents aged 25 and older holding a bachelor's degree or higher are:

1. West Virginia - 24.3%
2. New Mexico - 26.7%
3. Mississippi - 27.1%
4. Alabama - 27.8%
5. Arkansas - 28.0%

However, it's important to remember that these statistics do not necessarily mean that all or even most people in these states are uneducated. Factors such as access to education, economic opportunities, and individual circumstances can greatly impact educational attainment.
