Pergunta: who is going to the orange bowl this year

Resposta:
I cannot provide an answer to that question as I don't have access to real-time information or the ability to predict future events. The Orange Bowl is a college football bowl game, and the teams participating in it are determined through various selection processes, such as conference championships and rankings. To find out who is playing in this year's Orange Bowl, you would need to check the official College Football Playoff or Orange Bowl Committee announcements.
