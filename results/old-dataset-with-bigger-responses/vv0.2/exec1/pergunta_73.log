Resposta:
The Houston Astros moved to the American League (AL) as part of Major League Baseball's (MLB) realignment following the 1964 season. Before this move, the Astros were a member of the National League (NL) since their inception in 1962.

The primary reason for the Astros' switch to the AL was due to MLB's expansion efforts during that time. In 1961, MLB announced its intention to add two new teams – one in Houston and another in New York City (which eventually became the Mets). The NL already had 10 teams at that time, so it was decided that both expansion franchises would join the AL instead.

Additionally, the AL's designated hitter rule, which was introduced in 1973, may have played a role in the Astros' move to the AL.
