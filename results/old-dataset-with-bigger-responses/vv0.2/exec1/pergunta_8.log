Pergunta: where was the church of latter day saints founded

Resposta:
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church, was founded in New York, United States, on April 6, 1830. The church was established by Joseph Smith, who claimed to have received a golden plate from an angel containing ancient scriptures that would become the Book of Mormon. The church's official name reflects its belief in continuing revelation and the restoration of primitive Christianity through Smith as a prophet.
