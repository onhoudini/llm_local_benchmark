Pergunta: what is the star sign for september 15

Resposta:
The star sign for September 15 depends on the specific year. Here's how it works:

September 15 falls in two different zodiac signs, depending on when the Sun enters each sign during the year. The Sun moves from Virgo to Libra around September 23, so if your birthday is before that date, you'll be a Virgo, and if it's after, you'll be a Libra.

For example:
- If your birthday is on or before September 14, then you are a Virgo.
- If your birthday is on or after September 15, then you are a Libra.

So, for September 15 specifically, the zodiac sign can be either Virgo or Libra, depending on the year. To determine which one it is for a particular year, you would need to know the exact date of the autumnal equinox (around September 23) that year and compare it to September 15.

If you want to find out your specific star sign based on your birthdate, you can use an online zodiac calculator or consult an astrological calendar.
