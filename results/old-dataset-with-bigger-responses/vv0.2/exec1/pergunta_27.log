Pergunta: in humans what determines the gender of the offspring

Resposta:
In humans, the gender of the offspring is determined by the sex chromosomes carried by the sperm and the egg. A sperm can carry either an X or a Y chromosome. An egg can only carry an X chromosome. If a sperm with an X chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting offspring will be female (XX). If a sperm with a Y chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting offspring will be male (XY). Therefore, the gender of the offspring is not determined by the parents' genders or their physical characteristics, but rather by which sex chromosome is contributed by each parent.
