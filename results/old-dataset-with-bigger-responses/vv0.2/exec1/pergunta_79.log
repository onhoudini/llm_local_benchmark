Pergunta: which part of a corn plant would the kernels be

Resposta:
The kernels of corn are located in the ears or cob of the corn plant. An ear of corn is actually a compact inf Inflorescence, meaning it's a specialized flowering structure. Each kernel is essentially a seed enclosed by the protective layers – the pericarp and the testa. So, when you eat corn, you are consuming the seeds, not the actual plant or cob.
