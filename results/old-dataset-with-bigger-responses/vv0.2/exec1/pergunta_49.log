Resposta:
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures lenders against losses that may result from borrowers defaulting on their mortgages. This insurance allows lenders to offer more favorable mortgage terms, including lower down payments and less stringent credit requirements, to eligible borrowers. FHA's role in the housing market helps increase accessibility to homeownership for individuals who might not otherwise qualify for conventional mortgages.
