Resposta:
The Battle of Amiens, also known as the Hundred Days Offensive or the Second Battle of the Somme, took place from August 8 to 11, 1918, during World War I. It was primarily fought between the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), under the command of General Sir Douglas Haig, and the German Army, under the command of General Erich Ludendorff. Other Allied forces, including the French, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand armies, also participated in the battle. The Battle of Amiens is notable for being the largest single-day advance by the Allied forces since the beginning of the war and a turning point in the war's outcome.
