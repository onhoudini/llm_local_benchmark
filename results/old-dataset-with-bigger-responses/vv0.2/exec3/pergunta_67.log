Pergunta: what do you call a vest in the uk

Resposta:
In the UK, a vest is typically referred to as a "waistcoat." A waistcoat is a garment that covers the upper body from the waist up, leaving the midriff exposed. It usually has buttons down the front and is often worn as part of a formal or semi-formal outfit with a suit jacket or dress shirt. However, it's important to note that the term "vest" can also be used interchangeably with "waistcoat," especially in more casual contexts.
