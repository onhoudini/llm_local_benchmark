Pergunta: who is considered to be the inventor of the prepared piano

Resposta:
The prepared piano, a piano that has been altered by placing various objects on or inside its strings to change their pitch and timbre, was not invented by a single person but rather developed through experimentation by several composers and musicians in the early 20th century. Some of the most notable figures associated with the development of the prepared piano are:

1. John Cage (1912-1992): Although Cage did not invent the prepared piano, he is perhaps the most famous composer to have used it extensively in his works. He began experimenting with preparing the piano in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and his groundbreaking composition "Sonatas and Interludes" (1946-1948) is one of the most well-known pieces for prepared piano.
2. George Antheil (1897-1959): Antheil is often credited with being one of the first composers to use the prepared piano in a concert setting. His "Ballet Mécanique" (1924) was originally intended to be accompanied by an orchestra and a large number of prepared pianos
