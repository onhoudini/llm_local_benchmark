Pergunta: who sang out of my head over you

Resposta:
The song "Out of My Head (Over You)" was originally recorded by the American R&B girl group The Carters, which consists of Beyoncé and her sister Solange Knowles. However, there is a cover version of this song by German DJ and producer Tchami, featuring Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen. So, both versions have different artists singing the song.
