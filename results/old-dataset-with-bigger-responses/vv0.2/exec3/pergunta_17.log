Resposta:
The song "I'll Be Home for Christmas" was written by Kim Gannon and Walter Kent in 1943. The lyrics express the longing and anticipation of being with family during the holiday season, especially after being away due to military service or other reasons. The melody was originally used for another song titled "The Long Trail," but was later adapted for "I'll Be Home for Christmas." The most famous recording of this song is by Bing Crosby, which was released in 1943 and became a major hit during the Christmas season that year.
