Pergunta: who owns the rights to baby shark song

Resposta:
The "Baby Shark" song is based on a traditional Korean children's folk song called "Pass Me By, Baby Shark." Pinkfong, a South Korean education company, produced the popular animated video of the song. Pinkfong holds the copyright for their specific version and production of the "Baby Shark" song and related content. However, the original traditional folk song likely falls under public domain, as it predates modern copyright laws. It's essential to note that copyright laws can vary by country, so it's always a good idea to consult with a legal expert for specific situations.
