Pergunta: when do cory and topanga get back together after lauren

Resposta:
In the Disney Channel series "Boy Meets World," Cory and Topanga's relationship faces a brief separation after they graduate from college, as Topanga moves to New York City for law school while Cory stays in Philadelphia. However, they eventually reunite and get married in the spin-off series "Girl Meets World." So, in the context of the show's timeline, their reunion happens after Lauren but before the events of "Girl Meets World." In real life, the actors Ben Savage (Cory) and Danielle Fishel (Topanga) did not start dating until after the series ended.
