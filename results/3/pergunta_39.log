Pergunta: where did france colonize in the new world

Resposta:
France colonized several regions in the Americas during the Age of Exploration, primarily focusing on North America and the Caribbean. Some of the most notable French colonies include:

1. Quebec (Canada): Founded by Samuel de Champlain in 1608, Quebec City is one of the oldest European settlements in North America. The region was later expanded to form New France, which included present-day Ontario, Manitoba, and parts of the United States like Louisiana and the Mississippi Valley.

2. Acadia (Nova Scotia): Established by Pierre Dugua de Mons in 1604, Acadia was initially claimed by both the French and British but was eventually ceded to Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The descendants of these early settlers are known as Acadians or Cajuns (in Louisiana).

3. New Orleans (Louisiana): Founded by French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in 1699, New Orleans became a significant center for trade and culture in North America. The region was ceded to Spain in 1762
