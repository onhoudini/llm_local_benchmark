Pergunta: who sampled rick james give it to me baby

Resposta:
The song "Give It To Me Baby" by Timbaland featuring Nelly Furtado, from the album "Shock Value," samples Rick James' original version. However, another notable sample of this song is by Will Smith in his track "Miami" from the album "Big Willie Style." Both versions use a portion of the iconic bassline and vocals from Rick James' original song.
