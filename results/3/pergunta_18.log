Pergunta: icc world cup outside england first time sponsor

Resposta:
The first ICC Cricket World Cup held outside England was the 1975 World Cup, which was co-hosted by England and Wales. However, it's important to note that the tournament didn't have a title sponsor until the 1987 World Cup, when Benson & Hedges became the first official sponsor. So, while the tournament wasn't held in England for the first time until 1975, the concept of a title sponsor didn't exist until later.
