Pergunta: who sings now that we have love what are we going to do with it

Resposta:
The lyrics you've provided seem to be from a song, but they don't correspond to any specific known song in my database. However, the phrase "Now that we have love, what are we going to do with it" is reminiscent of several popular songs, such as "If You Don't Know Me By Now" by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes or "What Are We Going to Do With Our Love" by Diana Ross. Without more context, it's hard to determine the exact song you're referring to. If you provide more information about the tune, artist, or era, I might be able to help identify it more accurately!
