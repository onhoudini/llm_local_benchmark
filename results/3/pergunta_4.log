Pergunta: statue coming out of the ground in washington dc

Resposta:
The statue you're referring to is likely the "Freedom Statue" or more formally known as the "Freedom Memorial," located at the National Mall in Washington D.C. This statue, designed by Henry Bacon and sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is part of the Lincoln Memorial Complex. It represents the emancipation of the slave and the spirit of freedom embodied in Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. However, it's important to note that there are several statues in Washington D.C., so if this isn't the one you were thinking of, let me know, and I can help further!
