Pergunta: who went home on the first week of dancing with the stars juniors

Resposta:
The information about the contestants and their elimination on "Dancing with the Stars Juniors" can vary depending on the season. I don't have real-time data, so I can't provide specific details about the first week of a particular season. However, I recommend checking out reliable sources like the official Dancing with the Stars website or TV guides for accurate information about the show's contestants and their elimination order.
