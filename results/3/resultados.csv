mistral_v0.3,73,why were the houston astros move to american league,The Houston Astros moved to the American League (AL) as part of Major League Baseball's realignment in 2013. Prior to this  they had been a member of the National League (NL) West division since their inception in 1962.  The reason for the move was primarily due to MLB's implementation of interleague play in 1997  which allowed AL and NL teams to play each other during the regular season. However  because the Astros were in the NL West  they had fewer opportunities to play against AL teams compared to other NL clubs.  The realignment also aimed to balance out the number of teams in both leagues  as the AL had one fewer team than the NL at that time (14 vs 16). The Astros' move to the AL West division created a more even distribution of teams between the two leagues (15 each).  Additionally  the move allowed the Astros to play against other Texas-based teams like the Rangers and the eventual expansion team  the Mariners  on a regular basis. This was seen as beneficial for both the Astros and MLB  as it increased regional rivalries and,89.18253207206726,7,158720
