Pergunta: who came up with the name rock and roll

Resposta:
The term "rock and roll" as a description for a specific style of music originated in the United States in the early 1950s. It's difficult to pinpoint one individual as the inventor, but it was popularized by musicians like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Fats Domino. The phrase itself is believed to have been used in various ways before its musical connotation, including a dance move, a slang term for sexual activity, and a style of jazz music. However, the combination of these elements into the genre we know today as rock and roll can be traced back to African-American musicians in the post-World War II era.
