The Eastern Front during World War 1 was primarily located between the Russian Empire and the Central Powers (mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Ottoman Empire). It extended from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea and the Caucasus Mountains in the south. This front saw some of the bloodiest battles of World War 1, including the Battle of Tannenberg, the Brusilov Offensive, and the Battle of Gallipoli.
