Resposta:
The first ICC World Cup held outside England was in 1975, and it was sponsored by Kodak. This tournament took place in England and Wales, but subsequent editions held outside England were sponsored by different companies. For instance, the 1983 World Cup in England was sponsored by Pepsi, while the 1987 World Cup in India and Pakistan was sponsored by Coca-Cola. The 1992 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand was sponsored by Castlemaine XXXX, an Australian beer brand.
