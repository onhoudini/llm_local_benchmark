Pergunta: what is the italian word musicians use to describe playing a stringed instrument with a bow

Resposta:
The Italian term that musicians use to describe playing a stringed instrument with a bow is "suonare il violino" or simply "violino" for the act itself. However, it's important to note that this specifically refers to the violin. If you are referring to other stringed instruments played with a bow such as the viola, cello, or double bass, their Italian names would be "viola", "violoncello", and "contrabbasso" respectively, with the corresponding verb being "suonare la viola", "suonare il violoncello", or "suonare il contrabbasso".
