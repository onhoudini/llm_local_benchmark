Pergunta: when was the last time india won a gold medal in hockey at olympics

Resposta:
The last time India won an Olympic gold medal in hockey was at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. However, it's important to note that India did not participate in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the 1988 Seoul Olympics due to political reasons, so their most recent gold medal win was before those games.
