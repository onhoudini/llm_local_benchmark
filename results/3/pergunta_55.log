Pergunta: which branch of the us government makes federal laws

Resposta:
The legislative branch of the U.S. Government makes federal laws. This branch is composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Laws are made when both the House and the Senate pass the same bill, which is then sent to the President for signature. If the President signs it, it becomes a law. If the President vetoes it, the Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds vote in both chambers.
