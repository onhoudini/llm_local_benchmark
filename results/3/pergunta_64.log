Resposta:
The Convention on the Rights of the Child was a collaborative effort among various nations, international organizations, and human rights advocates. The United Nations played a significant role in its creation. The main drafting process took place from 1979 to 1989 under the leadership of the UN's Commission on Human Rights. The Convention was eventually adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1989, and it came into force on September 2, 1990. It is important to note that the rights included in the convention were based on existing human rights principles and standards, as well as new ones specifically tailored for children.
