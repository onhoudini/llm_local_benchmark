Pergunta: minimum age limit for chief justice of india

Resposta:
The Constitution of India does not specify a minimum age limit for the appointment of the Chief Justice of India. However, traditionally, the Chief Justice of India is appointed from among those who are above the age of 62 years. This is because the retirement age for Supreme Court judges in India is 65 years, and the Chief Justice is expected to serve until they reach that age. But it's important to note that there is no legal requirement stating that the Chief Justice must be over 62 years old at the time of appointment.
