Pergunta: what color is the president of south koreas house

Resposta:
The President of South Korea does not reside in a house, but in the Blue House (Cheong Wa Dae), which is the official residence and workplace of the President of South Korea. However, the Blue House itself is not painted a specific color. It's named "Blue" because it was originally built with blue tiles on its roof. The main building is white, and the overall complex includes various buildings in different colors.
